Real-Time Face recognization System
Here it takes real time dataset from user in dataset-creator.py after that it trains the data and detect according to the face and show the name and age.
In training the model take data from dataset and save it to a yml file according to the database structure.
Primarily it designed only for students.
Here I used OpenCv, Numpy and Pillow.
